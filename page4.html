  <p>This program is realy simple. The programe is always tracking where this mouse is and translates it to coordents which the program can use. The programe will draw a 10 by 10 bubble around the mouse. The coroul is deturmened by your mouses x and y position and a constent of 0 withing an RGB value, making it look like this (MouseX,MouseY,0). The programe also detects is your mouse is being presed, and when it is, it use and RGB value that looks like this insted (0,MouseX,MouseY).</p>
