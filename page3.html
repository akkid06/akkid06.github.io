  <p>The animation on this page contiuesly draws the same image over agian with positions on the points changed. the program will draw the points a surten number of units away based on a number assinge to them. For instents, the yellow vertical dot has 0.5 and the light blue diagenal point has a 5. You can also make a point move in the oposit direction by ussing a negetive, which i did for the dark blue diagenal and horizontal purble points. To have the points loop around the screen you need to cheack if the point is at the border and then move it to the other side of the screen. I know what the code looks like and how to get it to do what I want, I just dont know why it dose that. This will make them lop infinetly on all sides of the screen.</p>
