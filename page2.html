  <p>Upper Left:<br>
  I made this using and ellipse with the coordinates (100,100) and the size values of (75,50). That makes an ovel of diferent width or hide as you change the size values. The ellipse in the center of the image has coordinates of (200,200) and size values of (25,25), making it a perfect circal.<br><br>
  Upper Right:<br>
  Triangles are made by asinging 3 diferent sets of coordinates then the program connects them together and fills it with the colour you assinge. The coordinates used for this triangle are (300,75), (275,125), and (325,125).<br><br>
  Lower Left:<br>
  To draw a rectange, you need to stat the starting coordinates which are the upper left corrner of the rectangle. The coordinates I used where (75,275). Then you add how far you want the rectangle to go horazontaly and verticaly, with the first number being for the horazontal and the second for the vertical. My numbers are (50,50), making this a perfect square.<br><br>
  Lower Right:<br>
  Points are perfect circals that only requir a set of coordinates to place, with the size being dissied by your stroke weight. I used a stroke weight of (5) for these points with the coordinates of (315,300), (285,3000), (300,315), and (300,285).<br><br>
  Borders:<br>
  All the borders in this image where made ussing lines. Lines require 2 sets of coordinates and the line is drawn between them. The width of the line is dissied by the stroke weight. The aqua lines have a stroke weight of (1) and the black lines have a stroke weight of (3).To draw the aqua lines, I just draw a line from (0,200) to (400,200) for the horazontal line and (200,0) to (200,400). The black outline was made by drawing between(0,0) and (0,400), then (0,400) and (400,400), fllowed by (400,400) to (400,0), and finally (400,0) to (0,0).</p>
